A fun lil habit tracker that I am using on my desktop to ensure I am completing my daily goals (like one hour of learning a new language, workouts etc). I wanted to use the app "Done" but did not fancy paying a subscription for such a simple functionality.
Most of the coding was done with the assistance of Google Gemini but significant debugging was needed. 
I will try to find time and flesh out detailson the kind of issues I ran into with the AI generated code. 

1: .models vs models
2: instance
3: naming issue
4: wrong date
